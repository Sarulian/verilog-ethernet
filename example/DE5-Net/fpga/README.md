# Verilog Ethernet DE5-Net Example Design

## Introduction

This example design targets the Terasic DE5-Net FPGA board.

The design by default passes spf_a_rx data into a buffer and then out of sfp_a_tx.s  

FPGA: 5SGXEA7N2F45C2
PHY: 10G BASE-R PHY MegaCore

## How to build

Run make to build.  Ensure that the Altera Quartus toolchain components are
in PATH.  

## How to test

Needs update.
